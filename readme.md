## Section 3
**Go Workspace**
- one folder - any name, any location
  - `/bin`: executable
  - `/pkg`: packages from go
  - `/src`: source code that you create

What is cool about this is that we can be anywhere on our machine and just
add the three directories listed üëÜüèæ, and we have a workspace that will act
just like the old school way of setting up a go project where we have to be at `~/go`

**Go Commands**
- `go version`: print the version
- `go env`: print environment variables
- `go help`: go help command
- `go fmt`: go fmt command which formats your code
    - `./`
- `go run`: is `go build` and `go run` which builds and executes the code in the project


**Go Modules**
This is the default behavior as version 1.13 of Golang
